<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultrasonic Flow Tester Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intrusive</li><li>Non-Intrusive</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Ultrasonic Flow Tester market is categorized into two types: Intrusive and Non-Intrusive. Intrusive testing involves making physical contact with the flow path, often requiring the installation of a probe in the pipeline to measure the velocity. This method is suitable for accurate and reliable measurements but may disrupt the flow and require downtime for installation. On the other hand, non-intrusive testing does not require any physical contact with the flow path. It uses external sensors that can be clamped onto the exterior of the pipeline, providing convenient and quick measurements without interrupting the flow.</p></p>

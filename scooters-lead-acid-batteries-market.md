<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Scooters Lead Acid Batteries Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>VRLA Batteries</li><li>Flooded Batteries</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Scooters Lead Acid Batteries market consists of two types - VRLA Batteries and Flooded Batteries. VRLA (valve-regulated lead-acid) Batteries are maintenance-free and sealed, preventing the leakage of electrolyte. They are typically used in scooters due to their small size and greater efficiency. Flooded Batteries, on the other hand, require regular maintenance as the electrolyte levels need to be checked and refilled periodically. They are less expensive but tend to have a shorter lifespan compared to VRLA batteries. Both types are used in the market to cater to different customer preferences and budget considerations.</p></p>

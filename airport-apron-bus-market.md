<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Airport Apron Bus Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electric Type</li><li>Fuel Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Airport Apron Bus market can be divided into two main types: Electric Type and Fuel Type. Electric Type apron buses are powered by electricity, typically stored in batteries. They provide a more sustainable and eco-friendly option, with zero-emission operations. On the other hand, Fuel Type apron buses run on conventional fuels like diesel or compressed natural gas (CNG). While they still offer efficient transportation, they generate emissions and are less environmentally friendly compared to the Electric Type. The choice between these market types depends on the airport's sustainability goals and infrastructure capabilities.</p></p>

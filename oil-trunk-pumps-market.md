<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oil-trunk Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tube Pump</li><li>Rod Pump</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The oil-trunk pump market consists of two main types: tube pump and rod pump. Tube pumps are devices used to extract oil from underground reservoirs by creating a vacuum that draws the oil up through a tube. On the other hand, rod pumps operate by using a piston rod to push oil to the surface. Both types of pumps play a crucial role in the oil industry, enabling efficient extraction of oil resources from the ground for further processing and utilization.</p></p>

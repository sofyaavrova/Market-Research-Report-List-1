<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The HFO Refrigerant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Type I</li><li>Type II</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The HFO (hydrofluoroolefin) refrigerant market is divided into two types: Type I and Type II. Type I HFO refrigerants are designed as single-component refrigerants that can be used as a drop-in replacement for various existing hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerants. On the other hand, Type II HFO refrigerants are blended refrigerants that are formulated by combining HFOs with other gases or refrigerants. Type II HFOs are commonly used when multiple properties are required, such as flammability reduction or improved performance, compared to Type I HFOs.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Inhaled Glucocorticosteroid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Aerosol</li><li>Spray</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The inhaled glucocorticosteroid market consists of two types: aerosol and spray. Aerosol products deliver medication in the form of a fine mist, which is inhaled into the lungs through a metered dose inhaler (MDI) or a dry powder inhaler (DPI). This type of delivery is widely used and convenient for patients. On the other hand, spray products provide medication in a liquid form that is sprayed directly into the nostrils. Sprays are typically used to manage nasal symptoms such as allergies or inflammation, offering targeted relief. Both aerosols and sprays play a crucial role in treating respiratory and nasal conditions.</p></p>

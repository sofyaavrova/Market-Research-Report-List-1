<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Trailer Brake Controllers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Proportional Brake Controllers</li><li>Time-Delayed Brake Controllers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Trailer brake controllers are used to regulate the braking of a trailer when connected to a vehicle. There are two main types: proportional brake controllers and time-delayed brake controllers. Proportional brake controllers sense the braking force applied to the vehicle and adjust the trailer brakes accordingly, providing a smooth and proportional braking experience. Time-delayed brake controllers, on the other hand, have a preset time delay that determines when the trailer brakes engage after the vehicle brakes are applied. This type is less sensitive and may require manual adjustments for optimal performance.</p></p>

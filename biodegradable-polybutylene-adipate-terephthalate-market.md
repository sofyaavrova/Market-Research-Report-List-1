<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biodegradable Polybutylene Adipate Terephthalate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low-Crystallinity</li><li>High-Crystallinity</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The biodegradable polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT) market can be divided into two types: low-crystallinity and high-crystallinity. Low-crystallinity PBAT refers to a type of PBAT that is less structured, resulting in lower melting and crystallization temperatures. This type is often used in applications requiring flexibility and stretchability, such as films and bags. On the other hand, high-crystallinity PBAT has a more structured composition, leading to higher melting and crystallization temperatures. It is suitable for applications that require better mechanical properties and thermal stability, like injection molded parts and fibers.</p></p>

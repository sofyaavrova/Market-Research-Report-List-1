<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Irrigation Pivots Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mobile</li><li>Fixed</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Irrigation pivots are used in agriculture to deliver water efficiently to crops. There are two main types of irrigation pivots: mobile and fixed. Mobile pivots are designed to move along a field to cover larger areas, allowing farmers to irrigate different sections as needed. They are flexible and can be easily relocated. On the other hand, fixed pivots are stationary and cover a smaller portion of land. They are more suitable for smaller fields or areas with obstacles that prevent mobility. Farmers choose the type of pivot based on the size and layout of their fields.</p></p>

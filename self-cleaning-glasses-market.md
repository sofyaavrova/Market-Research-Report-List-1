<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self-Cleaning Glasses Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrophobic Coating</li><li>Hydrophilic Coating</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The self-cleaning glasses market consists of two major types of technologies: hydrophobic coating and hydrophilic coating. Hydrophobic coating is a water-repellent technology where the glass surface is coated with a thin layer that prevents water droplets from sticking to it, causing them to roll off easily. On the other hand, hydrophilic coating attracts water and creates a layer of moisture on the glass surface, which helps in removing dirt and stains when it gets wet. Both technologies aim to minimize the need for regular cleaning, providing convenience and ease of maintenance to the users.</p></p>

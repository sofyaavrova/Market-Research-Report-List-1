<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neonatal Ventilator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The neonatal ventilator market consists of two main types: invasive and non-invasive. Invasive neonatal ventilators are used in critical situations where babies require mechanical support to breathe. These ventilators deliver air directly into the lungs through an artificial airway, such as an endotracheal tube or a tracheostomy. Non-invasive neonatal ventilators, on the other hand, provide respiratory assistance without the need for an artificial airway. They deliver air through a mask or nasal prongs, allowing the baby to breathe more naturally. Both types of neonatal ventilators play a crucial role in providing respiratory support to newborns.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fiber Reinforced Composite Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastic Composites</li><li>Thermosetting Composite</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Fiber Reinforced Composite Market consists of two main types: Thermoplastic Composites and Thermosetting Composites. Thermoplastic Composites are composed of polymers that can be melted and reformed multiple times without significant loss of their mechanical properties. They are easier to process and recycle, making them cost-effective and versatile. On the other hand, Thermosetting Composites are made from polymers that are irreversibly cured or hardened during the manufacturing process. Once cured, they cannot be re-melted or reformed, providing enhanced resistance to heat and chemicals.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Bag Inflators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pyrotechnic Inflators</li><li>Stored Gas Inflators</li><li>Hybrid Inflators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Air Bag Inflators market comprises three main types: Pyrotechnic Inflators, Stored Gas Inflators, and Hybrid Inflators. Pyrotechnic Inflators operate by igniting a small explosive charge, which rapidly generates gas to inflate the airbag. Stored Gas Inflators rely on pressurized gas stored in a cylinder, which is released during a collision to inflate the airbag. Hybrid Inflators combine both pyrotechnic and stored gas technologies, offering a more controlled and versatile release of gas for airbag inflation. These three types cater to different safety requirements and preferences in the automotive industry.</p></p>

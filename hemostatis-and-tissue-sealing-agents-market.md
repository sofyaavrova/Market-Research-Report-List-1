<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hemostatis and Tissue Sealing Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Topical hemostat</li><li>Adhesive & tissue sealant</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Hemostasis and tissue sealing agents are used to control bleeding and provide secure sealing of tissue during surgical procedures. Topical hemostats are applied directly to the bleeding site to promote clotting and stop bleeding. Adhesive agents are biocompatible substances that bond tissues together to form a seal, preventing fluid leakage or air entry. Tissue sealants, on the other hand, are liquid or gel-like substances used to seal tissues by forming a mechanical barrier or promoting adhesion between tissues. These agents enhance surgical outcomes by minimizing blood loss and improving tissue healing.</p></p>

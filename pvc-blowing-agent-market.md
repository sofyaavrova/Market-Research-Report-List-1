<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PVC Blowing Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Exothermic Blowing Agent</li><li>Endothermic Blowing Agent</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>PVC blowing agents are additives used in the manufacturing of PVC products to create a cellular structure by introducing gas bubbles. Exothermic blowing agents release gas when heated, causing an expansion of the PVC material. This can result in a lower density and improved insulation properties. On the other hand, endothermic blowing agents absorb heat from the surrounding environment during the expansion process. This provides a cooling effect, making endothermic blowing agents suitable for applications where heat-sensitive materials are involved. Both types provide unique characteristics and are chosen based on specific requirements.</p></p>

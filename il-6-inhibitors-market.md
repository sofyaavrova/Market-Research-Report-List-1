<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The IL-6 Inhibitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>IL-6 Receptors Antagonistic Anitibody</li><li>Antibody against IL-6</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>IL-6 inhibitors are a type of medication that target IL-6, a protein that plays a role in inflammation and immune response. IL-6 receptor antagonistic antibodies work by binding to the IL-6 receptor and blocking its activation, which helps reduce inflammation. Antibodies against IL-6 directly bind to IL-6 molecules and prevent them from interacting with their receptors. Both types of inhibitors are used in the treatment of various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, helping to alleviate symptoms and improve the quality of life for patients.</p></p>

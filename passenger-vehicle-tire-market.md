<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Passenger Vehicle Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tire</li><li>Bias Tire</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Passenger vehicle tire market consists of two main types: radial tire and bias tire. Radial tires have their ply cords arranged radially from the tire's center. This design provides better grip, heat dissipation, fuel efficiency, and improved handling. On the other hand, bias tires have ply cords diagonally crossing from bead to bead. They offer better load-carrying capacity, impact resistance, and higher durability. Radial tires are more commonly used in modern passenger vehicles due to their superior performance and comfort, while bias tires are preferred for heavy-duty applications or specific conditions where their benefits outweigh radial tire advantages.</p></p>

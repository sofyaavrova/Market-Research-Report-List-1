<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chikungunya Rapid Testing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Serological Testing Techniques</li><li>Molecular Testing Techniques</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Chikungunya rapid testing market consists of two main types: serological testing techniques and molecular testing techniques. Serological testing techniques detect antibodies produced by the immune system in response to the chikungunya virus. This type of testing is usually done using blood samples and provides rapid results. On the other hand, molecular testing techniques directly detect the genetic material (RNA) of the chikungunya virus. These tests are highly sensitive and specific but may require more complex laboratory equipment and expertise. Both types of testing play a crucial role in the rapid and accurate diagnosis of chikungunya infections.</p></p>

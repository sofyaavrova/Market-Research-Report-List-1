<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aerospace Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent-Based Coating</li><li>Water-Based Coating</li><li>Powder Coating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The aerospace coatings market consists of three main types: solvent-based coatings, water-based coatings, and powder coatings. Solvent-based coatings are composed of liquid solutions with an organic solvent that helps the coating to adhere to the aerospace surface. Water-based coatings use water as a solvent instead, making them more environmentally friendly. Powder coatings, on the other hand, are applied as dry powder and then heated to form a protective layer on the surface. Each type offers unique advantages and is used in different applications within the aerospace industry.</p></p>

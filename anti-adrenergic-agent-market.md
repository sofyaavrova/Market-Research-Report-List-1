<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti Adrenergic Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>α Blockers</li><li>β Blockers</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Anti-adrenergic agents are a type of medication that inhibit the effects of adrenaline in the body. α blockers work by blocking α-adrenergic receptors, which helps relax blood vessels and reduce blood pressure. They are commonly used to treat hypertension and certain prostate conditions. On the other hand, β blockers work by blocking β-adrenergic receptors, which slows down the heart rate and decreases the force of contraction. They are primarily used to treat cardiovascular conditions like hypertension, angina, and arrhythmias. Both α blockers and β blockers play a vital role in managing various health conditions related to adrenergic activity.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Recovered Sulphur Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Claus Process</li><li>Claus Process and Tail Gas Treatment</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Claus process is a traditional method used in the recovered sulphur market to convert hydrogen sulphide gas into elemental sulphur. This process involves various stages like thermal oxidation, catalytic conversion, and condensation. On the other hand, the Claus process with tail gas treatment is an advanced version that further minimizes sulphur dioxide emissions by treating the tail gas from the Claus unit. This process involves additional steps, such as the use of catalysts to convert remaining sulphur compounds and absorbents to remove sulphur dioxide, ensuring stricter environmental compliance. Both processes are commonly used in the recovered sulphur market, with the latter being more environmentally friendly.</p></p>

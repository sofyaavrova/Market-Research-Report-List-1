<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Waste Gas Boilers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Horizontal Boiler</li><li>Vertical Boiler</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Waste gas boilers are divided into two categories: horizontal boilers and vertical boilers. Horizontal boilers are designed with a horizontal configuration, where the combustion gases flow horizontally inside the boiler tubes. This design is suitable for applications with limited space availability. On the other hand, vertical boilers are designed with a vertical configuration, where the combustion gases flow vertically through the boiler tubes. This design is commonly used when there is a need for a compact boiler with a small footprint. Both horizontal and vertical boilers are used in waste gas applications to recover heat from industrial processes.</p></p>

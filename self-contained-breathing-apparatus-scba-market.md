<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open-Circuit SCBA</li><li>Closed-Circuit SCBA</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) market includes two types: open-circuit SCBA and closed-circuit SCBA. Open-circuit SCBA is the most commonly used type, where the exhaled air is released into the environment. It is less expensive and more versatile, making it suitable for firefighting and industrial applications. On the other hand, closed-circuit SCBA recirculates exhaled air, removing carbon dioxide and providing a longer oxygen supply. This type is mainly used in confined spaces and hazardous environments where a longer-lasting oxygen supply is required.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Boiler Deaerator Tanks Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tray-Type Boiler Deaerator Tanks</li><li>Spray-Type Boiler Deaerator Tanks</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Boiler deaerator tanks are used in steam power plants to remove dissolved gases from feedwater, preventing corrosion and enhancing boiler efficiency. Tray-type boiler deaerator tanks feature trays that allow the water to come into direct contact with steam, effectively removing dissolved gases. Spray-type deaerator tanks utilize high-pressure sprays to remove gases, dispersing water droplets for maximum contact with steam. Other types, such as vacuum-type or vacuum-spray deaerator tanks, combine both tray and spray mechanisms. These tanks offer various options for efficiently removing dissolved gases and ensuring optimal boiler performance.</p></p>

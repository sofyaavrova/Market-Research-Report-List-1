<p><strong>The Facial Pump Bottle Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Airless Facial Pumps</li><li>Atmospheric Facial Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Facial pump bottles are available in two different market types: airless facial pumps and atmospheric facial pumps. Airless facial pumps utilize a vacuum system to dispense the product, preventing air from entering the bottle and preserving the quality and shelf life of the contents. Atmospheric facial pumps, on the other hand, rely on atmospheric pressure to dispense the product. Both types have their advantages and are suitable for different formulations, but airless facial pumps are preferred for sensitive or oxygen-sensitive products, while atmospheric facial pumps are more commonly used for non-sensitive formulations.</p></p>

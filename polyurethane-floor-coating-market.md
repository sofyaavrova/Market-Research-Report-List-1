<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyurethane Floor Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent Polyurethane Floor Coating</li><li>Non-Solvent Polyurethane Floor Coating</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Polyurethane floor coatings are divided into two main types: solvent-based and non-solvent-based. Solvent polyurethane floor coating consists of a solvent that evaporates during the curing process, leaving behind a durable and protective coating. This type of coating is known for its fast drying time and high levels of chemical resistance. On the other hand, non-solvent polyurethane floor coating does not contain any solvents and relies on a different curing process. It offers similar durability and protection, but with longer drying times and lower levels of chemical resistance.</p></p>

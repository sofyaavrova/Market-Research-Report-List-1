<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Food Mercury Analysis Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cold Vapor Atomic Absorption Type</li><li>Cold Atomic Fluorescence Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Food mercury analysis systems market types include the Cold Vapor Atomic Absorption (CVAA) Type and the Cold Atomic Fluorescence (CAF) Type. The CVAA type of system uses a cold vaporization technique to convert mercury in food samples into a gaseous form. This gas is then analyzed using atomic absorption spectroscopy to determine the mercury content. On the other hand, the CAF type directly measures the fluorescence intensity emitted from mercury atoms in the sample, without prior vaporization. Both systems are used for accurate and sensitive analysis of mercury in food samples.</p></p>

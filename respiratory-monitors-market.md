<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Respiratory Monitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pulse Oximeters</li><li>Incentive Spirometers</li><li>Peak Flow Meters</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Respiratory monitors are medical devices used to assess the functioning of the respiratory system. The market for respiratory monitors includes various types of devices such as pulse oximeters, incentive spirometers, peak flow meters, and other monitors. Pulse oximeters measure the oxygen saturation in a person's blood, while incentive spirometers help improve lung function by encouraging deeper breathing. Peak flow meters measure the maximum flow rate of air during forced exhalation. Other respiratory monitors refer to devices like capnographs, which measure the concentration of carbon dioxide in exhaled breath, and respiratory inductance plethysmography, which measures chest expansion during breathing. These monitors play a crucial role in diagnosing and managing respiratory conditions.</p></p>

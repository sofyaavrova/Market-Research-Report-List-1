<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rat Isolator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Pressure Isolator</li><li>Negative Pressure Isolator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Rat Isolator Market consists of two main types: Positive Pressure Isolator and Negative Pressure Isolator. A Positive Pressure Isolator creates an air barrier that prevents contaminants from entering. It maintains a higher pressure inside to keep the surrounding environment germ-free. On the other hand, a Negative Pressure Isolator removes air from the enclosure, ensuring that any potentially harmful airborne particles are contained within the isolator. Both isolators serve the purpose of protecting the rats and their environment, but differ in their approach to achieving it.</p></p>

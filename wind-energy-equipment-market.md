<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wind Energy Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-Supporting (Free-Standing) Tower</li><li>Guyed Tower</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The wind energy equipment market consists of two types of tower structures: self-supporting (free-standing) towers and guyed towers. Self-supporting towers are designed to stand independently, without the need for external support or guy wires. They provide higher stability, durability, and can withstand strong winds. On the other hand, guyed towers are supported by guy wires that provide additional stability. These towers are commonly used in areas with lower wind speeds or limited space for installation. Both types of towers play crucial roles in supporting wind turbines for efficient wind energy generation.</p></p>

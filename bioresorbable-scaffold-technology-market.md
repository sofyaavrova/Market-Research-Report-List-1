<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bioresorbable Scaffold Technology Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Metal Bioresorbable Scaffold</li><li>Polymer Bioresorbable Scaffold</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bioresorbable scaffold technology refers to a medical device used during cardiovascular procedures to treat clogged arteries. Metal bioresorbable scaffold and polymer bioresorbable scaffold are two types within this market. Metal bioresorbable scaffold is made of metals like magnesium or iron, providing mechanical support to the artery while it gradually dissolves over time. On the other hand, polymer bioresorbable scaffold is composed of biodegradable polymers that provide a temporary scaffold before eventually breaking down into harmless byproducts. Both types aim to restore blood flow and gradually disappear, eliminating the need for a permanent implant.</p></p>

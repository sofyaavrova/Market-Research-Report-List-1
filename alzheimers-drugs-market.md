<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Alzheimer\'s Drugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) Inhibitors</li><li>Glutamate Inhibitors</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Alzheimer's drugs market includes various types of drugs that aim to slow down the progression of the disease and alleviate its symptoms. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors are the most commonly prescribed drugs for Alzheimer's. They work by increasing the levels of a chemical messenger called acetylcholine in the brain, which helps improve memory and cognition. Glutamate inhibitors, on the other hand, regulate the levels of glutamate, an excessive amount of which can damage brain cells. Other drugs that target different mechanisms also exist, aiming to improve overall brain function in individuals with Alzheimer's.</p></p>
